<h1>The Best Movies Accordiong to Kevin</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Apart from being my favorite adaption to my favorite super hero, the realistic approach,<br /> 
compared to other super hero movies, is what separates this one apart from the others.</p>

<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</h3>
<p>An incredible ending to an already fantastic trilogy.<br />
Not counting the films after this one - _-</p>

<h3>The Grey</h3>
<p>These kinds of survival thriller movies really get my blood pumping.<br />
Liam Neeson really proved why he is one of my favorite actors.</p>
